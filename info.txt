Pounded yam is one of Nigeria’s most popular dishes that can be served with a variety of soups like Egusi, Ogbono, Vegetable and Okro soup. Yam, which is widely available, is boiled and pounded into a smooth mash. You’ll most likely find people eating pounded yam with Egusi, Banga, Ogbono or some other meal.

Mind you, Nigerians abroad prepare alternative pounded yam using yam flour, but it doesn’t taste like the original pounded yam. Although the Yoruba people are known to be fond of pounded yam, some other Nigerian Ethnic groups like the Ibos consume it especially during occasions such as the celebration of new yam festival.

Garri would pass as the king in the land of Nigerian dishes, as it is a household food in almost all Nigerian homes. There is a popular joke in Nigeria that, though Garri has no advert placement, yet, it sells more than other food products that advertise.

Garri is prepared from cassava tubers that have been fermented, but the tubers must undergo peeling, washing and grating into a mash prior to being fermented. The product gotten from this is then locally dried (roasted) to form fine flour.

Garri when mixed with hot water, becomes ‘Eba’, and can be served with almost all kinds of stews and soups. It can also be eaten with beans or as a snack.
